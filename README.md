<h1 align="center">Hello there and welcome!<br>My name is Gill. It is a pleasure 🙏<br>&nbsp;</h1>


## 🧑🏻‍💻 About me
I am a Toronto based Full Stack Developer with a strong passion for coding. I work a lot with Node.js, Express.js, and RESTful API  Architecture. When I'm not at my desk I'm usually training in the gym, reading on my kindle, or watching astronomy/engineering videos on youtube.


## 🛠️ I'm currently working on
#### AniBase: 
- An anime catalog and notekeeping platform with blog functionality.
- Users can search through its anime database using certain parameters (genre, studio, name, ratings, etc.) and find an anime series they want to watch.
- After creating a personal account, users can sign in and keep a log of what they've watched, their personal thoughts on it, a rating out of 10 and much more.
- Blog posts and discussions can even be created where people can comment and respond.
- Tech used:
