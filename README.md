## 🧑🏻‍💻 About me
I am a Toronto based Full Stack Developer with a strong passion for coding. I work a lot with Node.js, Express.js, and RESTful API  Architecture. When I'm not at my desk I'm usually training in the gym, reading on my kindle, or watching astronomy/engineering videos on youtube.


## 🛠️ I'm currently working on
#### AniBase: 
An anime catalog and notekeeping platform that functions to allow users to search through a catalog in a postgreSQL database using certain parameters (genre, studio, name, ratings, etc.) and find an anime series they want to watch. They can then log into their personal accounts and keep a log of what they've seen, their personal thoughts on it, a rating out of 10 and much more. Users can even start discussions and respond to discussion comments.

## I’m currently learning
